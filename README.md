# sNCL (simple Nested Context Language)

## Why I created sncl:
NCL is the standard language for development of applications for the Brasilian System of Digital TV for the [Ginga](http://ginga.org.br/) ([also here](https://github.com/TeleMidia/ginga)) middleware. NCL was originally designed for use by designers and other types of content produces, however, it being a XML application, the final document can become quite large and complex when the application begins to grow.
Besides that, the language syntax can also be quite complex, or difficult to understand.

With that in mind, I created the sNCL language, so the proccess of authoring these applications can become easier and swifter for the developers. The development of the syntax of the language was guided by the syntax of [Lua](http://www.lua.org/), which is a small language designed for embedded systems, with a simple, easy to learn and understand syntax.

Feel free to visit the [wiki]() to get more information about the language.
